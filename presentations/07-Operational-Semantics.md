# Dynamic semantics
— the semantics of the programming language statements at the run time.

## Approaches
### Operational Semantics
The meaning of the program is specified as a sequence of computational steps for some abstract machine.

### Axiomatic Semantics
The meaning of the program is defined in terms of effects on the program statements on assertions about the program state.

### Denotational Semantics
The meaning of the program is formalized as a mathematical object (denotation).

# Operational semantics

Program execution may be understood as a step-by-step process that evolves by mechanical application of a fixed set of rules.

Rules describe how language constructs affect the state of some *abstract machine* that provides the mathematical model of computation. Each state of the abstract machine is called *configuration*.

# Big-step and small-step operational semantics
Small-step operational semantics (Structural Operational Semantics, SOS): step-by-step transformation of configurations in abstract machine is defined by set of rewrite rules.

Big-step operational semantics (natural semantics): program execution is described in terms of recursive evaluation of subphrases of a program. Each nontrivial syntactic domain (subset of abstract syntax tree constructors) has some specific evaluation relation.

# Structural operational semantics
## Set-theoretic abstract machine model
Consider programming language L with well-formed, well-typed programs P ∈ Prog, inputs I ∈ Inputs and answers A ∈ AnsExp.

Structural operational semantics for L is five-tuple S = 〈 CF, ⇒, FC, IF, OF 〉

* cf ∈ CF — __domain of configurations__ for an abstract machine
* ⇒ — __transition relation__, "⇒" ⊆ CF × CF. Two configurations are in transition relation iff there is a __(one step) transition__ from cf to cf'

cf ⇒ cf' ⇔ 〈 cf, cf' 〉 ∈ ⇒

$⇒^*$ — reflexive transitive closure of ⇒. Sequence of transitions cf $⇒^*$ cf' is called **transition path**.

Configuration cf is __reducible__ if there is some cf' such that cf ⇒ cf', otherwise cf is __irreducible__.

Transition relation $⇒$ is __deterministic__ if for every cf there is exactly one $cf'$, otherwise ⇒ is __nondeterministic__.

# Structural operational semantics
Structural operational semantics for language L is five-tuple S = 〈 CF, ⇒, FC, IF, OF 〉

- Irreducible — all irreducible configurations
- FC — set of **final configurations** which yield the correct answer, FC ⊂ Irreducible
- Stuck = Irreducible / FC — set of stuck states, nonfinal irreducible configurations (e.g. error states)

- IF : (Prog × Inputs) → CF — **input function**, transforms a program and its inputs to an initial configuration

- OF : FC → AnsExp — **output function**, maps a program and its inputs to an initial configuration

# Program behavior
Outcome = AnsExp + ErrorResult (+ — disjoint union)

Deterministic behavior, if $⇒$ is deterministic:

$beh_{det}$ : (Prog × Inputs) → Outcome

$beh_{det}$ 〈 P, I 〉 | IF 〈 P, I 〉 $⇒^*$ cf ∈ FC = AnsExp ↦ Outcome (OF cf)

$beh_{det}$ 〈 P, I 〉 | IF 〈 P, I 〉 $⇒^*$ cf ∈ Stuck = ErrorResult

$beh_{det}$ 〈 P, I 〉 | IF 〈 P, I 〉 $⇒^∞$ = ∞


# Non-deterministic behavior
$\mathcal{P}(A)$ — powerset of $A$.

$$
beh : (\mathrm{Prog} × \mathrm{Inputs}) → \mathcal{P}(\mathrm{Outcome})
$$

o ∈ beh( 〈P, I〉 ) **if** o = AnsExp ↦ Outcome (OF cf) **and** IF 〈P, I〉 $⇒^*$ cf ∈ FC 

o ∈ beh( 〈P, I〉 ) **if** o ∈ ErrorResult **and** IF 〈 P, I 〉 $⇒^*$ cf ∈ Stuck

o ∈ beh( 〈P, I〉 ) **if** o = ∞ **and** IF 〈P, I〉 $⇒^∞$

# Rewrite rules {.inference}
Usually relations on complex domains are specified in terms of **formal inference system.**

  antecendents
 --------------
  consequents
  

$antecedents = ⊘$ ⇒ rule is called **axiom**, otherwise **progress rule**.

Example axiom for stack-based language (placing constant on stack; 
configuration state = 〈 command sequence, stack 〉):

〈 N . Q, S〉 ⇒ 〈 Q, N . S 〉 [num]

〈 (Q) . R, S〉 ⇒ 〈 R, (Q) . S 〉 [seq]

   S = S1 . S2 . Sn
 ------------------------------------
  〈 swap . Q, S〉 ⇒ 〈 Q, S2 . S1 . Sn 〉 


If cf is a configuration in which first command in sequence is constant, then there is a transition from cf to cf' in which constant is moved from command sequence to the top of the stack.

# Big-step operational semantics
Big-step operational semantics (natural semantics): program execution is described in terms of recursive evaluation of subphrases of a program. Each nontrivial syntactic domain (subset of abstract syntax tree constructors) has some specific evaluation relation.

E.g. $→_{NE}$ for numerical expressions and $→_{Prog}$ for programs.

# Language properties
Usually operational semantics is used to prove some of the following properties:

* universality: the language can express all computable programs;
* determinism: the set of possible outcomes from executing a program on any
particular inputs is a singleton;
* strong normalization: all programs are guaranteed to terminate on all inputs
(i.e., it is not possible to express an infinite loop);
* static checkability: a class of program errors can be found by static analysis
without resorting to execution;
* referential transparency: different occurrences of an expression within the
same context always have the same meaning.
